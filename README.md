This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in shell scripting related to variable expansion within command substitution.  The script `bug.sh` showcases the problem, where variable modification within a subshell unexpectedly affects the outer shell. The solution (`bugSolution.sh`) provides a corrected approach, showing how to avoid the issue.  This bug is subtle and can lead to unexpected behavior in more complex scripts.
